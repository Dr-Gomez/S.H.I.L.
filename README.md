# S.H.I.L. — *Scenery Hypertext Intermediate Language*
**"May all browser bloom through my works."**

---

> *"Once, the web was a canvas—
> Now, it is a cage.
> S.H.I.L. is the key."*

## The Vision

**S.H.I.L.** is not just a markup language.
It is a rebellion.
It is the brush in the hand of the dreamer,
the chorus of code that sings beyond `<div>`s and `<span>`s.
Born from discontent with the monochrome tyranny
of ad-riddled, surveillance-soaked, templated sameness,
**S.H.I.L.** reclaims the web as *scenery* — a place of *feeling*, not just function.

Let sites be beautiful.
Let code speak in verse,
paint with pixels,
breathe with ideals.

See meaning behind every stroke.

## What is S.H.I.L.?

**S.H.I.L.** stands for **Scenery Hypertext Intermediate Language**.
It is a new foundation for web expression:
a language designed to **prioritize aesthetics, soul, and sovereignty**.

- **Artistic by Design**: Structure and style live as one — no CSS chains, no script prisons.
- **Free by Principle**: No telemetry. No locks. No secrets.
- **Poetic in Soul**: Encourages emotional, narrative-driven layout.
- **Modular & Minimal**: Complexity only where it's earned. Every tag should matter.

## Why Now?

Because the web is losing its magic.
Because every blog looks like a corporate memo.
Because the next generation deserves to **feel** something when they click a link.

Because art deserves a domain.
